# Computational infrastructure for this workshop

## Choose your own interface

QIIME 2 is designed to work through diverse interfaces to enable users with different computational backgrounds to work through the interface that they'll be most efficient with.

QIIME 2 is designed to provide the same functionality through different types of interfaces.
```

In this course you'll gain experience working with (a) QIIME 2 View, (b) Galaxy, and (c) q2cli, the QIIME 2 command line interface.
QIIME 2 additionally has a (d) Python 3 API, which you are free to experiment with in the Jupyter Notebook environment provided in the workshop container.

We'll start using Galaxy through the free public Galaxy server, https://cancer.usegalaxy.org.
As we generate results that we want to look at, we'll using [QIIME 2 View](https://view.qiime2.org).
We'll then spend the majority of the course interacting with QIIME 2 through its command line interface in a containerized environment that you'll run on your own computer.
Both of these will be available to you to complete your work after the course, and you can feel free to switch back-and-forth between these (and the other interfaces) as is helpful for you.
