# Setting Up Docker
## TODO: @Colin 

## File Organization 
Let's take a look at our directory organization
```shell
tree
```
This is what it should look like. 
```shell
/home/qiime2
├── matplotlib
├── q2cli
│   
```

Now lets make a directory for us to run our analysis in!

```shell
mkdir 2024-workshop
```

```shell 
tree
```

```shell
/home/qiime2
├── matplotlib
├── q2cli
├── 2024-workshop
```
